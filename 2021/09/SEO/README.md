### Basic Conception

> Index - Google stores all web pages that it knows about in its index. The index entry for each page describes the content and location (URL) of that page. To index is when Google fetches a page, reads it, and adds it to the index: Google indexed several pages on my site today.

> Crawl - The process of looking for new or updated web pages. Google discovers URLs by following links, by reading sitemaps, and by many other means. Google crawls the web, looking for new pages, then indexes them (when appropriate).

> Crawler - Automated software that crawls (fetches) pages from the web and indexes them.

> Googlebot - The generic name of Google's crawler. Googlebot crawls the web constantly.
