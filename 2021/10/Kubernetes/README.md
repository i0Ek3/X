# Kubernetes 

## A: What it is?

> Official words:

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.


## B: What problem should be solved?

Automating deployment.

> **What can Kubernetes do for you?**
>
> With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to be released and updated without downtime. Kubernetes helps you make sure those containerized applications run where and when you want, and helps them find the resources and tools they need to work. Kubernetes is a production-ready, open source platform designed with Google's accumulated experience in container orchestration, combined with best-of-breed ideas from the community.
