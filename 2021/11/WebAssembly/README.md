# WebAssembly

> Aka Wasm.

## A: What it is?

> Official words:

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of common hardware capabilities available on a wide range of platforms.


## B: What problem should be solved?

Provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed.

## C: How-To and why?

Compile a WebAssembly module from different programming languages([1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm), [2](https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/webassembly/), [3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm)).

## D: Examples validation

Check demo [Tanks](http://webassembly.org.cn/demo/Tanks/).


## E: Application?

Check [use cases](http://webassembly.org.cn/docs/use-cases/).


## F: Epilog

Nice to try cause of it's features: efficient and fast, safe, open and debuggable, part of the open web platform.
