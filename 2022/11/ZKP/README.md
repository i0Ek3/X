# Zero Knowledge Proof


## A: What it is?

A zero-knowledge proof is a way of proving the validity of a statement without revealing the statement itself.

## B: What problem should be solved?

Privacy security.

## C: How-To and why?

### Features

- Completeness
- Soundness
- Zero-knowledge

### Elements

- witness
- challenge
- response

## D: Examples validation

N/A.


## E: Application?

- Blockchain
- Anonymous payments
- Identity protection
- Authentication
- Verifiable computation

## F: Epilog

### Pros

The items we mentioned above, like:

- Efficiency
- Security
- Censorship resistant

### Cons

- More costs, such as hardware, proof verification
- Trust assumptions
- Quantum computing threats
